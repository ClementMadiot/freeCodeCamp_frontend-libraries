## <br /> <a name="introduction">âœ¨ Introduction</a>

Fourth project FreeCodeCamp to valid the certification "Front End Development Libraries"

**User Story :**

- User Story #1: My calculator should contain a clickable element containing an = (equal sign) with a corresponding id="equals".

- User Story #2: My calculator should contain 10 clickable elements containing one number each from 0-9, with the following corresponding IDs: id="zero", id="one", id="two", id="three", id="four", id="five", id="six", id="seven", id="eight", and id="nine".

- User Story #3: My calculator should contain 4 clickable elements each containing one of the 4 primary mathematical operators with the following corresponding IDs: id="add", id="subtract", id="multiply", id="divide".

- User Story #4: My calculator should contain a clickable element containing a . (decimal point) symbol with a corresponding id="decimal".

- User Story #5: My calculator should contain a clickable element with an id="clear".

- User Story #6: My calculator should contain an element to display values with a corresponding id="display".

- User Story #7: At any time, pressing the clear button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of display.

- User Story #8: As I input numbers, I should be able to see my input in the element with the id of display.

- User Story #9: In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of display.

- User Story #10: When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.

- User Story #11: When the decimal element is clicked, a . should append to the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted.

- User Story #12: I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, \*, /) on numbers containing decimal points.

- User Story #13: If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + _ 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 _ 7); if 5 _ - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 _ (-5)).

- User Story #14: Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.

- User Story #15: My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).

# Code

Should use tofixed method to rouding the result

```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    // not allow to start with multiple 0
    if (input === "00") {
      return setInput("0");
    }

    //* keyboard
    const handler = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      const key = e.key;

      // Ignore function keys (F1-F12)
      if (key.startsWith("F")  && !isNaN(Number(key.slice(1)))) {
        return;
      }

      if (key.match(/[0-9]/) || isOperator(key)) {
        e.preventDefault();
        setInput((prevValue) =>
          prevValue === "0" ? key : prevValue + key
        );
      }

      switch (key) {
        case "Enter":
          handleEqual();
          break;
        case "Backspace":
          setInput((prevValue) => prevValue.slice(0, -1) || "0");
          break;
        case "Escape":
          setInput("0");
          setOutput("");
          return;
          break;
        case ".":
          setInput(input + ".");
          setOutput(output + ".");
          break;
        default:
      }
    };

    document.addEventListener("keydown", handler);

    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener("keydown", handler);
    };
  }, [input, handleEqual, isOperator]);
```
